# custom model for image classifier
## 1. Before you begin
In the previous codelab you created an app for Android and iOS that used a basic image labelling model that recognizes several hundred classes of image. It recognized a picture of a flower very generically – seeing petals, flower, plant, and sky.

To update the app to recognize specific flowers, daisies or roses for example, you'll need a custom model that's trained on lots of examples of each of the type of flower you want to recognize.

This codelab will not go into the specifics of how a model is built. Instead, you'll learn about the APIs from TensorFlow Lite Model Maker that make it easy.

If you want more of a general grounding in how custom vision models are created, check out the series "Machine Learning Foundations" on YouTube.

Prerequisites
The previous Codelab in this learning path.
What you'll build and learn
How to train an Image Classifier custom model using TensorFlow Lite Model Maker.
What you'll need
No particular hardware is needed – everything can be completed using Google Colab in the browser.
